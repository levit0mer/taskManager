# A Simple Task Manager

In this sample project, I aim to build a simple Task Manager while using UI components from the open-source of [Monday Vibe](https://github.com/mondaycom/vibe).\
This Task Manager eventually will let you add tasks add filter them by task geo location with a map that I added.

## Tech Stack

- Bootstrap using Meta React `npx create-react-app YOUR-APP-NAME`
- Monday Vibe open-source UI components
- MapBox

## Test it out

`npm install`\
`npm start`
